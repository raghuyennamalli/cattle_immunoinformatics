IFNAR1 binds to STAT2 to initiate interferon (IFN) signalling..Type I interferons (IFNs) play an important role in innate immunity to protozoan parasites by binding the IFN alpha receptor, composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2;IL10RB, and regulating neutrophil/monocyte recruitment, neutrophil turnover, and Leishmania infection..IFNAR1 deficiency completely abolishes the reduction of sterol biosynthetic activity of macrophages during viral infections, thereby linking the regulation of lipid metabolism pathway with interferon anti-viral defence responses.
