It is a unique factor H (FH) ligand in that it can bind both of the two hot-spots of FH and can participate in the localization of functionally active FH..PTX3, an essential component of humoral innate immunity, and immunoglobulins share functional outputs, including complement activation, opsonization and glycosylation-dependent regulation of inflammation..PTX3, an inflammation-associated long pentraxin, plays key roles in innate immunity, female fertility and vascular biology. PTX3 octamer contains two fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) binding sites and this quaternary organization is required for the anti-angiogenic function of PTX3..PTX3 is produced by innate immunity cells (e.g. PMN, macrophages, dendritic cells) and it interacts with several ligands to play an essential role in innate immunity, tuning inflammation and matrix deposition. PTX3 provides a paradigm for the mode of action of humoral innate immunity..PTX3, serum amyloid P component (SAP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) belong to the pentraxin family of pattern recognition molecules involved in tissue homeostasis and innate immunity. PTX3 heterocomplexes with mannose-binding lectin (MBL) to trigger cross-activation of the complement system..PTX3 production is up-regulated in response to serum amyloid A, and contributes to the inflammatory pathogenesis of atherosclerosis..FCN3 and PTX3 are soluble oligomeric pattern-recognition molecules that interact with each other and act synergistically to activate the lectin complement pathway..PTX3 forms a complex with components of neutrophil extracellular traps in septic patients..Sputum PTX3 level are lower in cystic fibrosis patients due to proteolytic cleavage by Aspergillus fumigatus..PTX3 acts as an extrinsic oncosuppressor gene by regulating Complement-dependent, macrophage-sustained, tumor-promoting inflammation..PTX3 plays a non-redundant protective role in orchestrating tissue repair and remodeling by interacting with fibrin and plasminogen.",TRUE,FALSE

.MAVS-dependent RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signalling regulates the quantity, quality, and balance of the immune response to West Nile virus (WNV) infection..MAVS in peroxisomes induces a rapid interferon-independent expression of defence factors that provide short-term protection, whereas mitochondrial MAVS activates an interferon-dependent signalling pathway with delayed kinetics, which amplifies and stabilizes the antiviral response. .MAVS interacts with hepatitis B virus X protein and this promotes the degradation of MAVS via Lys(136) ubiquitination, preventing the induction of IFN-beta..MAVS (IPS-1) interacts with MFN1 upon virus-infection or 5'ppp-RNA activation through redistribution of MAVS to form speck-like aggregates in cells..MAVS (IPS1) plays an important role in regulating the host anti-viral response by binding to viral polymerase and inhibiting IFN-beta production. .MAVS negatively regulates the stability of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) and thereby inhibits apoptosis in the response to release of cytochrome c..The MAVS signalling pathway in non-myeloid cells is crucial for dsRNA-mediated natural killer cell activation. (Demonstrated in murine model).Tyrosine phosphorylation of MAVS at amino acid residue Tyr9 is critical for the induction of IFNB signalling..MAVS mRNA is degraded in response to foreign RNA and poly(I:C) to suppress hyper-immune reaction in late-phase antiviral signalling..MAVS is required for optimal NLRP3 inflammasome activity by mediating mitochondrial recruitment of NLRP3..MAVS is targeted by enterovirus protease to evade antiviral immunity..The binding of MAVS to Traf2, Traf5, and Traf6 is dependent on virus infection and MAVS polymerization.  The TRAF proteins promote ubiquitination that recruits IKBKG binding to the MAVS signalling complex. .Upon viral infection, MAVS recruits MKK7 onto mitochondria, leading to the induction of apoptosis by MAP2K7 activated MAPK9.Macrocyclic NS3-4A resistance-associated amino acid variants (RAVs) with substitutions at residue D168 of the hepatitis C virus protease result in an increased capacity of NS3-4A to cleave MAVS and suppress IFNB1 induction..RNA cleavage products, catalyzed by RNASEL, bind to DHX33 to facilitate the formation of a complex with MAVS and NLRP3 during viral infection. .HACE1 plays an inhibitory role in virus-induced signalling by disrupting the MAVS-TRAF3 complex..MARCH5 modulates MAVS-mediated antiviral signalling, preventing excessive immune reactions..MAVS directly interacts with TRAF6 through its potential TRAF6-binding motif 2.",TRUE,FALSE

It also plays a role in microRNA function, specifically its inhibitory effect on miR-155 expression in response to LPS..IL10 is a pleiotropic cytokine released in many tissues that mediates anti-inflammatory effects. IL10 also has an immunomodulatory role by stimulating NKG2D ligand expression on macrophages, thereby rendering them susceptible to natural killer (NK) cell elimination. .IL10 contributes to antiviral innate immunity during acute infection by restricting activation-induced death in natural killer (NK) cells. Blockade of Il10 receptor during acute murine cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection markedly reduced the accumulation of cytotoxic NK cells in the spleen and lung. (Demonstrated in murine model).IL10 has opposing functions in anti-microbial responses in its capacity to mediate protective immunity against some organisms but increase susceptibility to other infections..IL10-mediated suppression of natural killer/dendritic cell crosstalk leads to prolonged mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) persistence due to poor priming of MCMV-specific T cells. (Demonstrated in mouse).IL10 induces MIR187 to limit the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines..MIR145 directly targets HDAC11 to promote IL10 expression in TLR4-triggered macrophages..HIV-1 infection of macrophages modulates host responses to co-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis by attenuating IL10 responses thus contributing to the pathogenesis of tuberculosis in HIV-1âinfected patients..Secreted CCNA2 (CCN1) promotes anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 release from epithelial cells via integrin Î±VÎ²6-PKC, and this subsequently suppresses TNF, CXCL2 and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs..MIR29A inhibits IL10-induced cytokine release by targeting JAK-STAT3 in monocytes during sepsis.",TRUE,TRUE
